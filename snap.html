							<p>An impressive E-Commerce Web App that transforms the world of online shopping for jerseys. Leveraging the power of Python, Flask, Postgres-database, and the cloud-hosting prowess of Heroku, this project offers a comprehensive online shopping experience complete with product filtering, cart management, and an intuitive user interface.

								<br><br><b>Project Overview:</b>
								<br>This project introduces an E-Commerce Web App tailored for jersey enthusiasts. The app boasts an extensive collection of jerseys, each displayed with captivating images, detailed descriptions, prices, and a convenient "Add to Cart" button. The heart of the app lies in its interaction with a Postgres database, storing and retrieving jersey information. The user-friendly interface harnesses Bootstrap's card class for visually appealing product displays.
								
								<br><br><b>Key Features:</b>
								
								<br>- Product Filtering: The app empowers users to explore specific jersey categories using filters like region, club vs. national teams, sales, and even the IPL.
								<br>- User Management: For a seamless shopping experience, user registration and login are facilitated. If an unregistered user attempts to add items to the cart, jQuery presents a compelling prompt to encourage registration.
								<br>- Shopping Cart: The app features a shopping cart icon that indicates the number of items and subtotal. Clicking the cart icon opens a modal window showcasing cart details. This further extends to a complete shopping cart view.
								<br>- Purchase History: Users can explore their purchase history, enabling them to easily repurchase items they love.
								<br>- End-to-End Deployment: The project is fully functional and deployed on the Heroku cloud, ensuring accessibility to users.
								<br><br><b>Project Phases:</b>
								<br>The project journey unfolds through several key phases:
								
								<br>1. ER Diagram: Commencing with the foundational ER diagram, the database structure was defined, paving the way for seamless backend operations.
								<br>2. Data Collection: Sourcing appropriate product images played a crucial role in the project's visual appeal and authenticity.
								<br>3. Front-End Design: The user interface was meticulously designed to provide an intuitive shopping experience, inspired by e-commerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart.
								<br>4. Backend Implementation: Integration with a Postgres database on the Heroku Cloud ensured data persistence and retrieval.
								<br>5. Product Filtering: The implementation of advanced product filters mirrors user-centric platforms, enhancing the shopping journey.
								
								<br><br><b>Challenges and Achievements:</b>
								<br>Throughout the project, various challenges were overcome to ensure optimal functionality and aesthetics. Notably, streamlining the product entry process through a for loop minimized manual efforts. Uniformizing image dimensions significantly improved the visual coherence of the app.
								
								<br><br><b>Future Enhancements:</b>
								<br>The journey continues, with several potential areas for enhancement:
								
								<br>- Pagination: Dividing the webpage into pages would facilitate smoother navigation for users.
								<br>- UI Refinement: The user interface could be further refined to enhance the overall visual experience.
								<br>- Security: Addressing the storage of user credentials without encryption remains a priority for the next version.
